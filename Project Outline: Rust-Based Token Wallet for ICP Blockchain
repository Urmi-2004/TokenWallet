Creating a detailed outline for the Rust-based token wallet for the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain involves thorough planning, coding, testing, and documentation. Below is a structured approach to develop the project, including code snippets and instructions. This will cover smart contract development, deployment, testing, and documentation as requested.

### Project Outline: Rust-Based Token Wallet for ICP Blockchain

#### 1. Smart Contract Development

##### Token Definition

Create a Rust struct to represent the token. For this example, we'll define a simple structure that includes basic token attributes and balances.
